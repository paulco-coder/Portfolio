## Projects Included

### 1. In-Orbit Maintenance Project - ALTEN (2023-2024)

A comprehensive study on satellite maintenance in geostationary orbit, featuring trajectory optimization, docking simulation, and universal docking port design.

**Key Focus Areas:** Orbital mechanics, trajectory planning, 3D visualization, mechanical design

### 2.SPACE OASIS - The Spring Institute for Forest on the Moon (2024-2025)

The goal was to design a self-sustaining ecological module for space stations - a bioregenerative life-support system capable of producing oxygen, recycling water, and growing food in microgravity.

**Key Focus Areas:** Thermal analysis and simulation, structural mechanics, CAD design (SolidWorks), FEM simulations, optical systems, closed-loop life support, systems engineering (ECSS standards) 

### 3. Autonomous Space Drone Navigation Module - InfinitySpaceProviders (2025-2026)

Development of an autonomous navigation system for space drones performing inspection and servicing missions in orbit.

**Key Focus Areas:** Autonomous systems, embedded vision, swarm robotics, real-time control
