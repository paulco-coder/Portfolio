## Project overview

This six-member group project, developed in partnership with ALTEN, explores the concept of in-orbit satellite maintenance within the New Space industry framework. Over eight months, the team designed and simulated a complete in-orbit servicing mission, including:

- Trajectory planning and orbital rendezvous (docking) between a servicing spacecraft and a client satellite
- Design and sizing of a universal docking port for fuel, data, and power transfer

The project aimed to assess the technical and economic feasibility of a commercial maintenance solution for satellites in geostationary orbit (GEO).

## Context - New Space era

Traditional space missions rely on single-use satellites with limited lifespans. As launch costs and orbital congestion increase, extending satellite service life has become a major economic and ecological goal.

The New Space movement, driven by private companies such as SpaceX, OrbitFab, and Northrop Grumman, focuses on:

Reusable and maintainable systems

Reduced costs and faster development cycles

Open, iterative innovation processes

In this context, in-orbit maintenance (OOS: On-Orbit Servicing) offers several potential services:

Refueling: Extending lifetime by replenishing propellant

Repair: Replacing or fixing failed components in orbit

Towing: Using a "space tug" to reposition or deorbit satellites

The project‚Äôs ambition was to simulate and design a feasible OOS architecture inspired by emerging commercial concepts such as OrbitFab‚Äôs orbital refueling network.

üß≠ Project Management and Structure

The project was conducted in two main phases:

Research Phase (Oct‚ÄìDec 2024)

Individual literature reviews on in-orbit maintenance technologies

Brainstorming sessions and system breakdown using SADT diagrams

Evaluation of several mission architectures (single-use, modular, station-based)

Development Phase (Jan‚ÄìMay 2025)

Focus narrowed to the critical docking phase

The team was divided into two subgroups:

Trajectory and simulation group: orbital analysis, mission planning, GMAT simulations, and Unity visualization

Mechanical design group: conception and sizing of the universal docking port

Frequent team meetings, supervision by ALTEN mentors, and shared documentation through collaborative drives ensured coordination and traceability.

üß© Mission Architecture Analysis

The team studied three possible architectures:

Single-use servicer: One satellite maintains one client. Simple but expensive.

Modular design: Reconfigurable satellites composed of interchangeable modules (inspired by DARPA‚Äôs Phoenix program).

Station and Delivery System (final choice):
Inspired by OrbitFab‚Äôs "RAFTI" refueling ports, this concept uses:

Orbital fuel depots (stations) placed in GEO

Shuttle vehicles performing round trips to deliver fuel or perform repairs

This station-based approach minimizes launch costs and enables multiple maintenance missions from a single infrastructure.

üõ∞Ô∏è Docking Simulation: Trajectory and Orbital Mechanics

The docking phase was identified as the most critical and complex part of in-orbit maintenance.
The goal was to design a rendezvous trajectory between a servicing satellite and a client satellite in geostationary orbit, using:

GMAT (General Mission Analysis Tool) for orbital simulations

Python for numerical validation

Unity for 3D visualization

ü™ê Orbital Strategy

Target orbit: Geostationary (0¬∞ inclination, circular orbit at 42,164 km)

Station located in GEO to minimize ŒîV and allow multiple clients

Example client: Galaxy-11 satellite (real GEO satellite)

‚öôÔ∏è Simulation Setup

ŒîV optimization using GMAT‚Äôs Target and ImpulsiveBurn modules

Environmental modeling: Earth gravity harmonics (J2‚ÄìJ10), solar and lunar gravity, and radiation pressure

Full mission sequence simulated (departure, approach, docking, return)

Results:

Total ŒîV ‚âà 1.5 km/s for the nominal mission

Propellant consumption: ~218 kg (‚âà15% of the refueled mass)

Even with more complex orbits (inclined or eccentric), missions remain viable (<500 kg propellant)

A complete video animation of the mission was developed using GMAT output and Unity rendering

üî¨ Mathematical Modeling: Docking Phases

Two main proximity phases were studied and simulated:

Homing Phase (S1 ‚Üí S2):

Satellite aligns and reduces distance using simplified Gauss equations

Validation through Python simulation with numerical correction (ŒîVt ‚âà 2.77e-3 km/s)

Closing Phase (S2 ‚Üí S3):

Controlled approach within a few hundred meters using a radial orbit offset technique

Required ŒîVn ‚âà 6.3e-5 km/s

Equations of motion reconstructed as second-degree polynomial functions for Unity integration

These results formed the basis for the Unity docking simulation.

üíª Unity Simulation: Virtual Docking Demonstrator

To visualize and validate the docking process, the team developed a 3D interactive simulation in Unity, programmed in C#.

Key Steps

Environment setup: creation of satellite models and waypoints (S1, S2, S3)

Trajectory implementation: integration of mathematical models derived from Python

Physics engine: simplified gravitational interactions using Unity‚Äôs Rigidbody system

Docking logic: automatic alignment, proximity detection, and controlled approach using real-time scripting

The result is a dynamic visual model of a servicing satellite performing a complete approach and docking maneuver, from orbital alignment to final attachment.

‚öôÔ∏è Mechanical Design: Universal Docking Port

Parallel to the orbital study, the second subgroup designed a Universal Docking Interface (UDI) capable of:

Mechanical connection

Fluid transfer (refueling)

Electrical and data transmission

Methodology

Benchmark of existing solutions:

Apollo Docking System (manned missions)

OECS from Orbital Express (2007)

RAFTI interface by OrbitFab (fluid transfer standard)

3D CAD Modeling (SolidWorks):

Creation of a compact, unmanned docking mechanism

Integration of multiple subsystems:

Fluid port: flow management and sealing system

Electrical connector: power transfer interface

Data port: digital communication link

Thermal and mechanical reinforcements

Dimensioning and Integration:

Structural sizing to resist launch loads and in-orbit stresses

Thermal considerations for varying space conditions

Final assembly modeled and validated through SolidWorks 3D integration

The result is a multifunctional docking port designed to serve as a standardized interface between orbital assets, compatible with future servicing missions.

üìà Main Achievements

Definition of a commercially viable in-orbit maintenance architecture

Realistic trajectory simulation and energy budget analysis for GEO missions

Creation of a Unity-based virtual docking demonstrator

Design and dimensioning of a universal multi-purpose docking port

Application of aerospace engineering methodologies for verification and validation

üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Teamwork and Professional Experience

Throughout this eight-month group project, the six team members learned to work as a cohesive engineering unit, handling:

Project management (Gantt tracking, deliverables, documentation)

Technical communication with industrial mentors at ALTEN

Division of roles between simulation, design, and integration

Application of theoretical knowledge in mechanics, orbital dynamics, and system design

This collaborative project strengthened the team‚Äôs ability to design, simulate, and justify a complete space mission, bridging the gap between academic theory and real aerospace engineering challenges.
